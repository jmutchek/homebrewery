# Our Game
We play Dungeons & Dragons to step into the roles of larger-than-life characters and escape the stresses of the day-to-day. For a few hours every month we expect to take risks, face life-or-death decisions, and laugh out loud. This is a game with no winners or losers and often the least optimal move is the most fun.

## What we Play
1.	We play a cooperative game and are not in competition with the DM
2.	We play a game of shared storytelling where the spotlight moves from player to player
3.	We play a party of flawed characters where party and character optimization is not required or encouraged

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>

## When we Play
1.	Once per calendar month
2.	Two start times for each game (a) arrival – the earliest our host would like you to show up at their house and the best time to come to chit chat, eat, bitch about work, etc. (b) gametime – the expected start time for the session
3.	We will only play if the DM and three or more players are available as scheduled; if not we skip and regroup for the next scheduled session

## How we Play
### Core Tenants
1.	No one is disrespected; any player has the right to call a break and step out at any time, no questions asked
2.	Players know their character and abilities better than anyone else (including the DM)
3.	When a rule at the table is unclear or unknown the DM will make a call and move on
4.	We minimize side chats and stay in the game, suggesting a break at the table if necessary
5.	Everyone leans in during combat, even when its not your turn; be ready to act when its your turn
6.	We wait for other players to ask for feedback before making suggestions


### Role-Playing
1.	Have a background, not a backstory novel; you are not a loner or amnesiac; only include secrets in your backstory if you intend to share them with the party
2.	Shared storytelling; characters have a personal history in the world and can contribute their own knowledge to the table, just ask the DM “would I know that…?” or, better, suggest a detail or story that helps shape the story
3.	Game rules pertaining to the environment, NPCs, or monsters are known only to the DM – do not try to metagame though some assumptions make sense (e.g. swinging a sword at a ghost might not be effective)
4.	The DM will ask for skill check or saving throw rolls when they are necessary, premature rolls will be ignored. If you know that the roll is required (e.g. an attack roll or a skill check), have your dice in hand while you describe the action.
5.	Occasional PvP action does make for interesting role-play. In player vs. player actions, the player being acted against can request to contest the action.
6.	Narrated actions help everyone picture the action, make it specific and make it fun

>##### Rules the DM Breaks
> 1. The DM wants unsolicited feedback about his game and will offer the same to players
> 2. The DM will slow down game play when the life of a character is in the balance – check the rules, explore options, make a heroic last stand

<div style='margin-top:30px'></div>


### Ethics & Morality
1.	While some groups in the game world hold hatred or prejudices towards other groups, races, or subraces, members of the party will hold no such strong discriminatory feelings
2.	No culture or group in the game world will discriminate against on sexual orientation
3.	No curse or item will force a gender or orientation change upon a character
4.	Neither sexual acts or acts of torture will be narrated or role-played (cut to black if necessary) 
5.	All forms of sexual assault are prohibited in the game (as part of a background or active play)
6.	Slavery does exist in the game world and characters may find themselves enslaved; players will not enslave NPCs



### Game Balance & Difficulty
1.	Encounter difficulty will vary; most will be balanced but the party will find themselves in fights they cannot win.
2.	An encounter that proves too challenging at first attempt is the cornerstone of a great story arc and opportunity for role-playing: do some in-character research, seek help, make a plan, kick its ass.

### Technology
1.	Laptops and tablets make great character companions and are handy for looking up rules
2.	Phones are distracting at the table, please put them away for the game
3.	We will use an online forum to communicate logistics, record the chronicles of our adventure, make plans, and even some role-playing

## Our Campaign

### Character Creation
1.	Each character needs a background and a short story to tell the other players
a.	One paragraph of narrative is enough
b.	You are not a loner or otherwise remote from society (the hermit background or similar is fine)
c.	You have an internal motivation to go on adventures and take risks
d.	You have no agenda to betray the party
2.	Each character should also have:
a.	One connection to another character in the party
b.	At least one ally in the world (somebody or someplace you trust)
c.	At least one enemy in the world (an individual that you would actively pursue if the opportunity presented itself, but not an obsession that would cause you to ignore everything else)
d.	One short term goal (something that a person might try to accomplish in a few months of game time)
e.	One long term goal (something you may or may not ever accomplish, but influences your thinking)
3.	Character abilities are calculated by randomly: 6 x (4d6, drop the lowest) and assign as you want
 

### Campaign Progression
1.	After one or two introductory sessions, the party should have multiple quest hooks to choose from and the ability to explore any of them (or insert their own)
2.	We level up at role-playing milestones; tell the story of your growth and then ask the DM if the time is right
3.	Characters die, but the condition may be negotiable if the player is interested in a post-death story arc

## About your DM
1.	I generally follow the Rules as Written (RAW) but with some homebrew modifications
2.	I prefer to improvise more than prepare every detail
3.	I play monsters based on their Intelligence score – smart monsters will make smart(er) decisions, dumb beasts follow instincts and pack tactics. Some monsters will ignore a “downed” player, some will attempt to finish the job.
4.	I prefer exploration and combat over political intrigue
5.	I prefer epic stories that put the characters at the center of the action, but dislike when players become focused on just one goal at the expense of a fun diversion
6.	I strongly prefer that players contribute to the story both in and out of session; I will often run with a narrative or detail you provide as long as it isn’t a veiled attempt at a mechanical benefit

# House Rules

### Improved Critical 
When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack's damage against the target. Roll all of the attack's damage dice twice and add them together, then add any relevant modifiers as normal. At the end of your turn, you can take one additional standard action or move. __*The Lizotte Addendum:*__ *when two natural 20's are rolled during an attack with advantage or disadvantage, all of the attack's damage dice are rolled three times and added together. At the end of your turn, you can take two additional standard actions or moves.*

### Dropping to Zero Hit Points
Creatures that drop to zero hit points do not fall unconscious but are instead considered _dying_. The dying condition is identical to being unconscious except that the creature is aware of their surroundings and can speak falteringly. Upon failing the final death saving throw, a dying creature dies but can take a single Action with its final breath.

### Stabilize the Dying
Characters proficient in the Medicine skill can use their action to stabilize a dying creature within 5 ft. of them. The creature is automatically stabilized and a successful Medicine skill check (DC 5 + number of hit points below zero) restores the dying creature to 1 HP. When a creature recovers from the dying condition in this way they suffer one, cumulative level of exhaustion.

### Inspiration Dice
Anyone at the table can award Inspiration to another player. Inspiration is generally awarded for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, or flaw. Inspiration can also be awarded in the heat of the action, when the nature of a character's action has roots in their background or personality.

### Potions in Combat
Drinking a potion that is easily accessible (e.g. not in a backpack) requires only a bonus action.

### The Identify Spell
The Identify spell grants the caster a vision of the last time the item was used. This vision usually reveals one of the item’s abilities. Requirements for attunement are revealed but the item may have other properties that remain unknown.

### Casting Rituals
While casting a ritual, the caster must remain stationary for the duration of the ritual or effect.

```
```


### Skill Checks
Skill checks can only be rolled once for the party unless some significant change is introduced in the approach to the task. Only characters with proficiency in a skill can aid an ally in their skill check (which provides advantage on the ally's roll).

### Skill Challenges
During skill challenges, each party member can select any skill to use on their turn. The same skill cannot be used by two consecutive players or by the same player on consecutive turns. The DM will set a DC for each check based on the suitability of the skill to the challenge and on the use described by the player. The DC for some types of check (e.g. a stealth check) may be set based on an opponent's passive skill (e.g. passive perception). Skill checks cannot be used against other party members (e.g. persuasion, deception, or athletics cannot be used to influence another player's story).

### Haggling Check
Vendors in some cultures or locations may be open to haggling over the price of goods. All haggling will be settled with a contested skill check and not through role-playing.

### Willpower Saving Throws
Wisdom can be used as a “willpower saving throw” to occasionally determine whether your character does something that you, as a player wouldn’t necessarily choose to do.

### Nonlethal Damage
Calling out non-lethal damage implies a different use of the weapon in hand, which does 1d6 base damage + STR/DEX mod (no magic bonuses). Spells or other magical effects cannot be modified to inflict non-lethal damage.
