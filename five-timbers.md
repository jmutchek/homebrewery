> ##### Game Notes
> Five Timbers is not a full wizard, but is based loosely on the wizard class and is based on a modified version of the Retainer rules in Strongholds & Followers 1.12 (page 69). 
> 
> - Timber acts on the PC's initiative but can take actions and move independently.
> - To speed up combat, she automatically hits with her longbow when the PC hits with an attack or spell, but can also roll to attack if the PC misses or does not attack.
> - Retainers only make death daving throws after being at 0 hit points for 10 minutes; death is instant if a single blow causes damage over 2x the retainers maximum hp.
> - Her prepared spell count is determined by proficiency bonus + intelligence modifier.
> - Timber levels up one level on even PC levels.
